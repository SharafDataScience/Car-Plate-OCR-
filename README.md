# Car Plate Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

This project focuses on recognizing characters from car license plates using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. It leverages image processing and machine learning tools to identify and extract text from vehicle license plates.

## Features

- Preprocessing of car plate images (grayscale, blurring, thresholding)
- License plate detection using contour analysis
- OCR using Tesseract to extract characters
- Visualization of results

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pytesseract matplotlib numpy
